Parsing STL File using Numpy-STL and Halfedge Data Structure in Python

Detail article: https://medium.com/@harunijaz/parsing-stl-file-using-numpy-stl-and-halfedge-data-structure-in-python-implementation-34a765e9ac75 

This code demonstrates how to parse a STL file using the numpy-stl library and the halfedge data structure in Python.
Requirements

    numpy
    numpy-stl

Usage

   * Clone or download the repository
   * Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
   * Replace 'teapot.stl' in the code with the path to your STL file
   * Run the code using python parse_stl.py

The code will output the number of faces, vertices, and edges in the mesh represented by the STL file.

Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects. If you have any questions or improvements, please open an issue or a pull request in the repository.
